# EJS Experiments

This repository contains small projects and experiments built while learning **EJS (Embedded JavaScript Templates)** with **Express.js**.

These works were done as part of **The Complete Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp** on **Udemy**, taught by **Dr. Angela Yu**.  
Starter files were provided in the course, and I implemented the **core logic, EJS templates, and dynamic rendering features**.

---

## What I Practiced

- Passing data from Express to EJS views
- Using EJS tags
- Conditional rendering using `if / else`
- Looping over arrays in EJS templates
- Using partials with `include()`
